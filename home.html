          <h2>What is the Hubot?</h2>
          <p><strong>Hubot is your company's robot.</strong> Install him in your company to dramatically improve and reduce employee efficiency.</p>

          <h2>No seriously, what is Hubot?</h2>
          <p>GitHub, Inc., wrote the first version of Hubot to automate our company chat room. Hubot knew how to deploy the site, automate a lot of tasks, and be a source of fun in the company. Eventually he grew to become a formidable force in GitHub. But he led a private, messy life. So we rewrote him.</p>
          <p>Today's version of Hubot is <strong>open source</strong>, written in <strong>CoffeeScript</strong> on <strong>Node.js</strong>, and easily deployed on platforms like <strong>Heroku</strong>. More importantly, Hubot is a standardized way to share scripts between everyone's robots.</p>

          <h2>What can Hubot do?</h2>
          <p>We ship Hubot with a small group of core scripts: things like <a href="https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-google-images">posting images</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-google-translate">translating languages</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/gkoo/hubot-maps">integrating with Google Maps</a>.We also maintain a <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts">repository of community Hubot scripts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hubot-scripts">an organization of community Hubot packages</a> that you can add to your own robot.</p>
          <p>The real fun happens when you add your own scripts. Be sure to personalize your Hubot, too; your company's robot should be a place full of inside jokes, custom integrations, and general merriment.</p>

          <h2>How do I write my own Hubot scripts?</h2>
          <p><a href="https://hubot.github.com/docs/scripting/">Check out this documentation</a> for writing your own Hubot scripts. Then the sky's the limit; just add them to your generated `scripts` directory.</p>
          <p>If you write a Hubot script for taking over the world, please let us know.</p>

          <p>Hubot is a way of life. I didn't really invent Hubot as much as he spawned into our existence, ready to take it over like a ten-year-old aimbotting CounterStrike hacker. I wouldn't be surprised if Hubot could come up with the cure for cancer. And then he would disguise it in an animated GIF with the cryptic caption <em>Y U NO CANCER?</em>. I'm actually pretty frightened of the damn thing, now that you bring it up.</p>
